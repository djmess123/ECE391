VertLine needs implementing
- Copied horiz line, swapped x,y coordinates : semi functional, but glitchy
- swapped back some vars in address calculation, also removed plane incrementing,
    since all vertical lines are in the same plane : Working vert_line
- DONE!

Split Screen needs implementing
- changed CRTC regs to enable splitting at 200-18 : its too thin and mirrors the top of Screen
- VGA is in 400 line mode, changed to 400-(18*2) : good width, still mirrors
- attempt at shifting around offsets on different defines : very broken ,reverting
- changed starting line address to size of status bar : everything is more offset now
- Shifted where the game screen copies to in video memory, offset by statusbar size :status bar is now black, good i think?
- Decided not to try to use the same build buffer, making a separate build buffer for status bar
- separate build buffer works! tested by changing to solid color : still has a 1 pixel black line between the two
- Fixed line by increasing the virtual screen size to 201
- DONE!

Text to Graphics
- Going to use a similar approach as horiz_line_func, wish me luck!
- Rough draft works ok : text shows up reversed
- fixed reversed text by making algoirthm big-endian : tests show code crashes if text is longer than 8 chars
- gdb says something to do with line y=15
- fixed! i forgot to leave an extra 2 pixels on either side of the text, so it was trying to write past the build buffer
- changed colors to match level 1
- DONE!

Put game stats on status bar
- first draft successfully displays level, fruits, but time is wonky : no leading zeros
- looked up syntax, now properly leading zeros
- DONE!

Masking of player
- Decided to try and implement into draw_block, added extra arguments, changed all calls to match
- IT WORKED FIRST TRY, WOWWWW
- wait, when trying to make status bar update when stopped, now character disappears
- fixed, removed the need redraw, not necessary
- DONE!

Bug log MP2.2:
Transparent text:
Text comes up in proper location on screen but is black
Fixed by changing math to swap palette
text doesnt shift correctly at screen edges
Changed shift logic, was subtracting instead of adding in some cases
Text gets stuck when on larger maps
I was using logical window size instead of maze size, so it was limited to player positions within 200x320, swapped over to maze_dim_x
works!
Text pops up when eating fruit:
works!

Player color shift
Changes color at start but does not change after that
Forgot to subtract current time from start time
Works!

Change maze color
semi-transparent text color is wonky
I was using bit logic instead of adding an offset to get to the semi-transparent region of the pallet
Works!

Setting LEDs
Printk not showing up
Wasnt running on correct VM
Learned i need to run everything on the test machine I have linked to the TUX
Only low hex character showing on TUX
Forgot to shift number mask values in ioctl, fixed
Characters dont clear when unmasked
Added missingfunctionality
First draft works! Now to add sync
